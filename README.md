# MyPortfolio

This is a simple portfolio website I built to practice my front-end skills using only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript. The goal of this project was to focus on structure, layout, and styling fundamentals while keeping the site lightweight and accessible.

What I practiced
- Semantic HTML structure (header, nav, main, sections, footer)
- Layout techniques with CSS (Flexbox and Grid)
- Responsive design with media queries for multiple screen sizes
- Typography, color systems, and spacing for readable UI
- Accessible markup and forms (where included)
- Building a small site without build tools or JavaScript

Project structure (example)
- index.html — main entry and site structure
- css/ — stylesheets, organized by base/layout/components
- assets/ — images, icons, and other static files

How to view locally
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Mike1223q/MyPortfolio.git
2. Open the project folder and open index.html in your browser.

Optional: run a simple local dev server for a better experience (e.g., VS Code Live Server or: python -m http.server 8000).

Notes
- This project intentionally uses only HTML and CSS to strengthen fundamentals without relying on JavaScript.
- No build step or package manager is required — just open the HTML file.
- Images are optimized for quick loading; consider further optimization for production.
